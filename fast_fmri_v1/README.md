# FAST FMRI TASK

FAST task for fmri study in COCOAN Lab

Scanning from Dec, 2017 to May, 2018

Files in the 'data' folder is the example of data from one participant. If you want to know the example of the results, you can check the 'data' folder. 

'LJUD_Functions' folder should be included in the setting path of Matlab for using BIOPAC.

Although there are two font files, the code for running experiment don't need font setting or file. I commented out lines for the font setting in the code and it will be showed by basic font of the computer system.
